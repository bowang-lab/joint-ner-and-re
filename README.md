# End-to-end neural relation extraction using pre-trained language models

This repository contains the corpora and supplementary data, along with instructions for recreating the experiments, for our paper: "[End-to-end neural relation extraction using pre-trained language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.13415)".

> Note: This repo is a work in progress. I hope to have it cleaned up in the next few weeks.
